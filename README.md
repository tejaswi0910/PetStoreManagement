# PetStoreManagement
The project,  PET STORE Management System is a 
program that allows the pet store manager to handle all store activities online. 
The ability to manage various sell records and details of the pets available make this system very flexible and convenient. The pet store manager is a very busy person and does not have the time to sit and manage the entire activities manually on paper. This application gives him the power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single online system. Pet Store management project provides Entries and deletion of the new pets, staff management and other necessary pet management features.
The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to portable manage the Store activities.
